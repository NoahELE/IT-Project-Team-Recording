## üöÄ Features (User Stories Organized in Sprints)
- Our application is built upon a strong foundation of user-centric design. We prioritize features based on the needs and wants of our users, and organize them into sprints for systematic and efficient development. This not only ensures that our application meets the expectations of our users but also delivers a seamless and intuitive experience.
- For detailed key user stories organized in Sprints, see [User Stories](docs/Features.md).

---

## üåü Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- node.js & npm
- Python 3.10
- PostgreSQL 15.4
- Django 4.2.3
- django-cors-headers 4.2.0
- djangorestframework 3.14.0
- djangorestframework-simplejwt 5.3.0
- psycopg2 2.9.7
- drf-yasg 1.21.7

### Installation & Setup

#### üåê Frontend:

1. Navigate to the `web` directory: 
    
   ```bash
   cd web
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
3. Create a `.env` file inside the `web` folder and add the following line: `VITE_API_URL=xxxxxx`, where `xxxxxx` is the URL of the backend API.
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Build the project: `npm run build`
6. Run the project: `npm run start`
7. Currently deployed to <https://it-project-team-recording.vercel.app> with Vercel.
8. See more details in the [Frontend Documentation](docs/Frontend%20Documentation.pdf)
#### üì¶ Backend:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a PostgreSQL database and add the database credentials to the `settings.py` file.
4. Apply the migrations using `python manage.py migrate`
5. Run the server using `python manage.py runserver`
6. The server will be running locally on `http://localhost:8000/`
7. See more details in the [Backend Documentation](docs/Backend%20Documentation.pdf)

### Frontend and Backend Communication

- The frontend and backend communicate using REST APIs.
- The frontend sends requests to the backend using the `axios` library.
- The backend sends responses to the frontend in the form of JSON objects.
- The backend uses the `django-cors-headers` library to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend.
- The backend uses the `djangorestframework` library to create REST APIs.
- The backend uses the `djangorestframework-simplejwt` library to implement JWT authentication.
- The backend uses the `drf-yasg` library to generate Swagger documentation for the REST APIs.
- The backend uses the `psycopg2` library to connect to the PostgreSQL database.


### Frontend and Backend Build up

- create a new file called `.env` in the root directory of the project.
- Add the following lines to the `.env` file: `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`
- To fully build up the Front end, see the `README` file in the Front end directory.
- To connect to the Front end, run the server using `python manage.py runserver` and then run the Front end using `npm run dev` in the Front end directory.


### Frontend and Backend Deployment

- The frontend is deployed to Vercel. [Frontend Deployment PDF](docs/Frontend%20Deployment.pdf)
- The backend is deployed to Heroku. [Backend Deployment PDF](docs/Backend%20Deployment.pdf)

### Frontend and Backend Testing

- Frontend is testing manually, see the [Frontend Testing](docs/Frontend%20Testing.pdf) for more details.
- Backend is testing using Django test framework, see the [Backend Testing](docs/Backend%20Testing.pdf) for more details.

## üîç Traceability Matrix
- The Traceability Matrix is an essential tool in software development, ensuring that all requirements are met and validated through testing. It provides a clear linkage between the system's requirements and the tests designed to validate those requirements. By maintaining this matrix, we ensure that our software meets the highest quality standards and fulfills the needs of our users.

- For detailed testing and traceability matrix, see [Traceability Matrix](docs/TraceabilityMatrix.md).
